# Random Password Generator

## Overview
This program generates a random password of a given input length

## How to Run
### Dependencies
This script requires Python 3

### Steps to Execute
1. Clone to repo and run this script using the following command
python3 PasswordGen.py

## Limitations
- This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing highly sensitive information.
- The generated passwords are not cryptographically secure and may not meet strict security policies.
- Since it does not store passwords, you gotta remember or save them.
- The generated passwords are dependent on the input length so if you choose a short password length it may not be secure

## Ethical Considerations & Responsible Use
- Only for personal/educational use
- Don't actually use this as a replacement for password generation
- This tool could be used to generate weak passwords if the user is not careful, which could lead to security issues
- While the program is labeled as a password generation tool, it is not secure and should not be used in important situations such as banking.
